My name is Sajia Afrin. I am studying Computer Science and Engineering at Daffodil International University.
I’m 20 and I live in Savar, Dhaka. My dad was a banker. My mom is a teacher. I have two sisters and one brother. I’m interested in computers, singing, music, new movies, clothes.
I am a person who loves music. There are many things I like to do and to experience. I like to sing; I like to listen to music, I like Rabindra Sangeet, I like to think deeply, I like to dream; I like to talk, I like to listen. 
I like traveling. I like to see the moonlight at night on the rooftop; I like to look at the clouds in the sky with a blank mind, I like to do thought experiment when I cannot sleep in the middle of the night. 
I like flowers in spring, rain in summer, leaves in autumn, and fog in winter. 
I like to be alone, I like to be surrounded by people. I like villages, I like delicious food and comfortable dresses. I like to wear saree. I like land and nature, I like people. And, I like to laugh. 
This is a short introduction of myself. If you are interested in knowing more, read my articles, or take a look at my picture.
